# Build a Google.com clone
I completed this project as I want to practice on my HTML & CSS skills.
## Project Recap:
- Block elements stacking on top of each other
- Inline elements standing in a horizontal line
- Margin where we create whitespace outside of elements
- Padding where we create space inside of elements
- Borders is between padding and margin

Centering with margin

- must have a width
- margin left/right: auto

Flexbox

- display: flex
- justify-content
